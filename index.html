			<h2>What is GTA?</h2>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> (also known as GTA) is an open-world action-adventure video game series developed by many companies, including DMA Design (now known as Rockstar North), Rockstar Canada (now known as Rockstar Toronto), Digital Eclipse (now known as Backbone Entertainment), Rockstar Leeds. The games are published by Rockstar Games. Every game in the series features a main character who goes from being a lowly thief to the leader of a major crime organization. The protagonist completes missions given by many different kinds of characters, but can choose to complete side missions and other miscellaneous tasks such as taxi driving and racing, or just explore the game world. The player can choose to complete missions in whatever order they want. Almost all the games in the series take place in fictional settings, based on real locations in the United States. Notable features of the series include the ability to steal cars and the freedom to explore an open world.</p> 
			<h2>Success of GTA</h2>
			<p>The Grand Theft Auto series is one of the most popular video game series in the world, as it has sold 250 million copies, with GTA V accounting for 36% of sales. It is only behind Mario, Pok√©mon, and Tetris in terms of commercial success. An important factor in the series' success is the fact that it is compatible on a wide variety of consoles and devices, ranging from the PlayStation 4 to the iPhone. The series also has a massive and loyal fanbase, one of the largest of any video game series. Another key factor in the series' success is its interesting storylines, very detailed game world, and relatable characters.</p>
			<h2>GTA Universes</h2>
			<p>The GTA Series is comprised of 16 titles, which can be sorted into three universes. The graphics of a game and the storyline affect which universe the game belongs to. As of 2018, there are 3 universes: the 2D Universe, 3D Universe, and HD Universe. The universes do not share a common storyline, and locations featured in multiple universes are depicted very differently. For example, the city of Los Santos is featured in GTA: San Andreas (a 3D Universe game), and GTA V (an HD Universe game). While it is found in both games, the two renditions look nothing like each other.</p>
			<h2>Controversy</h2>
			<p>While hugely successful, GTA is a highly controversial video game series and is criticized for being violent, racist, sexist, and inappropriate, especially for younger audiences such as children. In one instance, after a sexually explicit unofficial modification was released for GTA: San Andreas, the game was taken off shelves and patched before it was re-released. The issue was so serious that a class action lawsuit was filed against Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar Games. Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games have also been sued by famous people such as actress Lindsay Lohan.</p>
